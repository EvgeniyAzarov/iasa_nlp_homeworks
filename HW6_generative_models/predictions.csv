Jake: Hey Cathy! Really? That's great!
Catherine: R u still working there?
Jake: I sure am. It's already been 5 yrs.
Catherine: Time flies. So I take it ur satisfied?
Jake: I am, I rarely think about changing companies. 
Catherine: Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion?
Catherine: I mean is there a clear career path?
Jake: Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits.
Jake: I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant.
Catherine: That's good to hear. Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer.
Catherine: I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck.
Jake: That's what I hear from most of my friends. It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays.
Jake: 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. 
Catherine: And how about the benefits u mentioned?
Jake: The company partially finances language & accounting courses.
Jake: There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare.
Catherine: That sounds like a dream :D Your HR dept. gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday.
Jake: That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed :)
Catherine: Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview?
Jake: Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company.
Jake: You can find them on the official website, in the ""about us"" section:  <file_other> 
Catherine: OK, I'll definitely take a look.
Jake: And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u.

Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?

Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.

Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.

695,13731166,"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday.

795,13864430,"Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?
Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death
Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?
Charles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something
Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:
Monica: <file_other>, <file_other>
Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me

Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine
Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
